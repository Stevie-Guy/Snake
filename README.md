# Snake
The classic beginner programmer game.

## Software used for this project
- Visual Studio Code version: 1.77.0
- Compiler: gcc (MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1) 6.3.0

## About this project
Because I was at the beginning of my programming journey, I took inspiration from a [snake code](https://www.instructables.com/C-Snake-Game-Simple/) I found on the internet, but I modified and improved it.

## How to play
### 1. [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Visual Studio Code for Windows 10 and the [GCC Compiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)(Windows 10 is necessary);
### 2. Download `snake_better.cpp` and put it in a folder. Compile and run `snake_better.cpp`, then find the file `snake_better.exe` that was created in the same folder and run it;
### 3. Use **WASD** to change direction and collect @ to grow. You can go through walls.
